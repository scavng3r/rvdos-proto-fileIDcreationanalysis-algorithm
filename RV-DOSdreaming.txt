I am a file*

command ((file)*scan256) makenotice!

file*=makenotice! unless makenotice?

file*=makenotice? is way of identify.marker creation for unknown$info

command ((file)scan256) comes from system by execution not obeservation
yet Identity.marker is human readable and when viewed
I am file*    //* is the systems queue to intervene unless a hang up is wanted
command ((file)scan256)
which translates to

makenotice! or makenotice?

each makenotice creates an identity marker regardless of activity
when viewed a reinforcingverification-RV is executed an the file notices itself.

\\1\repeatonly\nodouble* if execute double notice only identity marker recieves error for multiple execution in RV-DOS environment.

hence the research verifiable part

verification through identity.marker creation which only creates a log of human readable error and puke.
no matter execution environment.
