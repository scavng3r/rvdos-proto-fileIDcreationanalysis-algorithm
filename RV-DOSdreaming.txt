please note one must have anytype of      file*.*

///possible to produce output by .rvdos extension adding? and then removal for non file tampering?? and possiblity for portable thru usb 
or sd?   known issues include failure to blutooth transfer of a .rvdos extensioned file to lg g7 one-this issue can be remidied by usb 
file transfer and possibly OTG cable(untested) or transfer of sd card(untested)///

command ((file*)*.scan256) makenotice!<file*.*>makenotice?

file*.*=makenotice! unless makenotice?

file*.*=makenotice? is way of identify.marker creation for unknown$info

process of id creation is is filescan=unknown$info=id.mark\1\repeatonly\nodouble*dumprvdos
tada
file id created and rv'd!

rvdosdump is an experimental feature and must not be considered in future releases unless specifically stated it is included
all rvdosdump does is create a simple file in SIMPLE TO READ format. advanced users need not use rvdosdump ending

Simply change the rvdos file to text and read.

Id.mark contains alot more system puke than n00b list output

rvdosdump will contain sys info and various markers including extension and file size and color content by "samplesip"
sample sip is experimental - basically samplesip is the equivilant of a paint color catcher
so ROYGBIV spectrum or black and while or greyscale or snapchat filter yada yada blah blah

command ((file*)*scan256) comes from system by execution not obeservation
yet Identity.marker is human readable and when viewed id.mark*update occurs and sample is added stating that this document
 had been rv'd this many times

file*.*   

//*.* is the systems queue to intervene unless a hang up is wanted in whic case it may be possible to queue multiple files for scanning 
in succession? 

note the periods are replaced by a ) when executing command so the file DOES under go some fore of change


so...

command ((file*)*scan256)
which translates to

makenotice!<file*.*>makenotice?

each makenotice creates an identify.marker regardless of activity
so

unknown$info=identify.marker"exampletest1001"

when viewed a reinforcingverification-RV is executed and the file notices itself by experimental nodouble* rule on 1\repeatonly

so basically re-verification by this route  ((file*)*scan256 makenotice!<file*.*>makenotice? = unknown$info = 
identify.marker"exampletest1001"= file*.*


\\1\repeatonly\nodouble* if execute double notice only identity marker recieves error for multiple execution in RV-DOS environment.
(EXPERIEMENTAL)

hence the research verifiable part

verification through identify.marker creation which only creates a log of human readable error and puke.
no matter execution environment.
